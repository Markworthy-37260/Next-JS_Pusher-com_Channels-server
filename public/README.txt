Hi there, and welcome to the public section of this repository, which is doubling as the webroot of this project** _and_ a small library of public resources.  So: if it's not in here, don't bug me about it, OK?

[[ **to build a secure chat-server using Pusher.com's 'Channels' product. ]]

Presently (=Feb '24), I am serving such resources to myself via githack (see <https://raw.githack.com/>).  Hence, I pasted <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Markworthy-37260/Next-JS_Pusher-com_Channels-server/main/public/JSBI_etc.js> in there to obtain <https://raw.githack.com/Markworthy-37260/Next-JS_Pusher-com_Channels-server/main/public/JSBI_etc.js>, thereby to write the HTML...

  <script src="https://raw.githack.com/Markworthy-37260/Next-JS_Pusher-com_Channels-server/main/public/JSBI_etc.js" type="module"></script>

...at, for instance, the work-in-progress prototype at <https://scrimba.com/scrim/c9kBBmsZ>.  My plan is to get as much of the code working in scrims (see eg <https://scrimba.com/scrim/cgwvaPfG>, which looks like nothing but prototypes a protocol and computes and verifies digital signatures - check the browser log!) or, at worst, the official TypeScript playground at <https://www.typescriptlang.org/play> before deploying with (probably) netlify.

Thanks for your interest.  If you have questions, I'm easy to email: pshr AT cpt-ra DOT bid

Best wishes, -Marcus
